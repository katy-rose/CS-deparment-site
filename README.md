# CS-department-site

This is a mock website for the UTD computer science department. This is one of the first websites I built while taking a Web Development class. 
The layout was determined based on assignment rules, as was the use of jQuery in specific locations as opposed to throughout the entire Javascript file.

The back end to manage log in authentication, applying to the school, and checking to see if a user was accepted by the school was created with PHP and MySQL.
