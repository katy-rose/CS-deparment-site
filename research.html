				<p>Cyber Security Research in the UT Dallas CS department is conducted within the umbrella of the Cyber Security Research and Education Institute. Its origins go back to October 2004 when UTD’s Cyber Security Research Center (CSRC) was established soon after which it received the NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence designation in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) in June 2004. After receiving the NHA/DHS CAE in Research in 2008 and a $1.8 million Scholarship for Service (SFS) award from the NSF in 2010, our efforts and in cyber security research education were combined to establish Cyber Security Research and Education Center in January 2012. Subsequently, due to significant growth in faculty hiring, research and education in cyber security, the Cyber Security Research and Education Institute was established in April 2013.</p>

				<p>Work in Intelligent Systems (IS) involves several aspects of Artificial Intelligence, with a special focus on Natural Language Processing, Speech and Machine Learning.  Many faculty and students in the IS track are involved in the Human Language Technology Research Institute, which has been in existence since 2002. The goal of the Human Language Technology Research Institute (HLTRI) is to incorporate activities in a broad spectrum of disciplines such as natural language processing, speech recognition and synthesis, knowledge acquired from texts and text mining from a variety of genres. These activities enable computers to interact with humans using natural language capabilities and to serve as useful assistants to humans by providing services such as automatic text understanding and retrieval, question answering, automatic translation and speech recognition. HLTRI is one of the very few Institutes in the world dedicated to the study and research of language and its automatic processing. Work in the HLTRI is cross-disciplinary, attracting researchers from several schools and departments in the University. This is justified by the cross-disciplinary aspects of language processing and artificial intelligence. Our faculty have expertise in several areas of IS, allowing them and their students to generate original and valuable research with many applications, e.g. processing electronic medical records, capturing the semantics of texts on the Web and in social media as well as proving summaries of discussions and spoken dialogs.</p>
