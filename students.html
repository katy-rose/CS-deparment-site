		<h3>ACM Special Interest Groups</h3>
		<p>ACM UTD is the official University of Texas at Dallas Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). ACM UTD is focused on giving back to the engineering community here at UT Dallas and beyond through events, projects, ACM Labs, ACM Industry Series, HackUTD, and more</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="studentp">
		<h3>Computing Scholars Program</h3>
		<p>The Computing Scholars Honor Program (CS2) is designed to attract students with excellent academic records and provide them a cohort elite style of classes taught by our best instructors at a deeper level of theory and mathematics. The program aims to prepare participants for a career in research in academia, or at top industrial research labs and top high-tech companies.</p>
		<p>The Computing Scholars Program has a specially designed curriculum based on fundamental mathematical and scientific principles. The courses integrate discussion of current research, recent discoveries, and open problems into a rich logical progression of firmly related topics.</p>
		<p>Admission to the program is mainly by invitation and will be limited to no more than 30 students per year. The selection committee also entertains nominations from parents, teachers, and others familiar with an applicant’s academic standing.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="studentp">
		<h3>Center for Computer Science Education & Outreach (K-12)</h3>
		<p>The UT Dallas Center for Computer Science Education & Outreach (CCSEO) provides summer camps, workshops during school breaks/holidays, weekend clubs, online clubs, programming contests, custom workshops & campus tour for schools, custom camps/workshops off-site for schools/groups, weekly after-school clubs in nearby schools, teaching training workshops, career day presentations, FREE workshops to the community on MLK day of service, hands-on workshops for UT Dallas students and professional development workshops for adults.</p>
